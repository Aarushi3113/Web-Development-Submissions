<h2> <a name="Basketball">BASKETBALL </a> </h2>
<p> Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, 
compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketbal through the defender's hoop while preventing the opposing team from 
shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth 
three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point 
free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an 
additional period of play is mandated. </p>
<p> Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, 
both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots—the lay-up, the jump shot, 
or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may 
collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot 
without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling. </p>

<h2> <a name="Football">FOOTBALL </a> </h2>
<p> Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word 
football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football 
include association football; gridiron football; Australian rules football; rugby football; and Gaelic football. These various 
forms of football are known as football codes. </p>
<p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.
Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the
19th century.The expansion of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence 
outside the directly controlled Empire.By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic 
football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.
In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 
20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world. </p>

<h2> <a name="Hockey"> HOCKEY </a> </h2>
<p> Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal 
using a hockey stick. There are many types of hockey such as bandy, field hockey, ice hockey and rink hockey.In most of the world, 
the term hockey by itself refers to field hockey, while in Canada, the United States, Russia, Eastern and Northern Europe, the term 
usually refers to ice hockey. </p>
<p> The first recorded use of the word hockey is in the 1773 book Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, 
Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education by Richard Johnson, whose chapter XI was titled "New Improvements on 
the Game of Hockey".The belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by King Edward III of England is based on modern 
translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games "Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & 
Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam".The English historian and biographer John Strype did not use the word "hockey" when he 
translated the proclamation in 1720, instead translating "Canibucam" as "Cambuck";this may have referred to either an early form of 
hockey or a game more similar to golf or croquet.The word hockey itself is of unknown origin. One supposition is that it is a 
derivative of hoquet, a Middle French word for a shepherd's stave.The curved, or "hooked" ends of the sticks used for hockey would 
indeed have resembled these staves. Another supposition derives from the known use of cork bungs,in place of wooden balls to play
the game. The stoppers came from barrels containing "hock" ale, also called "hocky".</p><br>
